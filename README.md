# Cyber-Sec Project [0]


- This is the first little project I have completed from the
  recommended project list at https://github.com/EONRaider/100-redteam-projects.

- I am working through these projects as I have an interest in cyber-security that I would like to develop.

- This project is a TCP server that receives messages.
- 

> Main difficulty I faced was setting up and correctlyI am working through these projects as I have an interest in cyber-security that I would like to develop. using TELNET to check the server.

> Main thing I gained from this was more confident use of node.js and command line.


Next project shortly!
