# Cyber-Sec Project [0]


&nbsp;
&nbsp;

## What this project is:

- This is the first little project I have completed from the
  recommended project list at https://github.com/EONRaider/100-redteam-projects.

## Where does the idea come from:

- I am working through these projects as I have an interest in cyber-security that I would like to develop.

## Why am I doing it?

- This project is a TCP server that receives messages.

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

## Main difficulty

> **Setting up and correctly using TELNET to check the server.**

&nbsp;

## What I've gained

> **More confident use of node.js and command line.**

Next project shortly!
